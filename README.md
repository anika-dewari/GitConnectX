# GitConnectX
GitConnectX analyzes GitHub’s developer network using BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and PageRank to identify key contributors and collaboration patterns. It extracts data via APIs, processes it using data structures, and visualizes interactions with graph models. This helps researchers and developers explore open-source ecosystems efficiently.
